# Searchbox Keywords
Introducing.... Searchbox Keywords! Searchbox Keywords is a mod that allows people to add keywords, using a lang file, to items so that the item shows up when the keyword is searched.

![an example of it in use](https://cdn-raw.modrinth.com/data/az2vzjlu/images/7701dd49afa5f3f0c7a9cba15ba5ff7e234a6f3a.png)

## How to use
you create a lang file and add 
`"<block/item, look in the mods default lang if you arent sure>.<mod namespace>.<block/item id>.keyword": "<series of keywords seperated by spaces>"`

any mod can also add its own keyword thing to its lang file and it will automatically be compatable

this mod works by appending invisiable text to the end of an items name, so it will work with any search box that searches for an items name
